The explanations and information provided on this page are only general <br>and high-level explanations and information on how to write your own <br>document of a Privacy Policy. You should not rely on this article as legal <br>advice or as recommendations regarding what you should actually do, <br> because we cannot know in advance what are the specific privacy policies <br>you wish to establish between your business and your customers and <br> visitors. We recommend that you seek legal advice to help you understand <br> and to assist you in the creation of your own Privacy Policy.

Privacy Policy - the basics
<br><br>
Having said that, a privacy policy is a statement that discloses some or all <br> of the ways a website collects, uses, discloses, processes, and manages the <br>data of its visitors and customers. It usually also includes a statement <br> regarding the website's commitment to protecting its visitors' or customers' <br>privacy, and an explanation about the different mechanisms the website is <br>implementing in order to protect privacy. 
<br><br>
Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations of what must be <br>included in a Privacy Policy. You are responsible to make sure you are <br>following the relevant legislation to your activities and location. 
<br><br>
What to include in the Privacy Policy
<br><br>
Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses these types of issues: <br>the types of information the website is collecting and the manner in which it <br> collects the data; an explanation about why is the website collecting these <br>types of information; what are the website's practices on sharing the <br>information with third parties; ways in which your visitors and customers <br>can exercise their rights according to the relevant privacy legislation; the <br>specific practices regarding minors' data collection; and much, much <br>more.
